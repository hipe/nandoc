# NanDoc
this is a hack. this is nanDoc.

## Summary

hack of [nanoc3](http://nanoc.stoneship.org) to generate a static site of your ruby project from your README etc.

## Description

Generate a static site to document your ruby project from your README and other markdown-formatted documentation.  Inject code examples from your unit tests into the generated docs.  Extremely fragile hacks and some cool additions to nanoc3.

(This entire site is generated from a README and other docs with all
of the code examples coming from unit test "scrapes.")

## Does this match you?

* Tired of all the other unit-test-driven static documentation-site-generators
that fall short of the usual promises?

* Agile development has your doc content going rapidly stale?

* Sick of typing what you want to write by hand?

* Repeatedly hearing yourself repeat to yourself "Don't Repeat Yourself?"

* Don't underkill your documentation when it's so easy to &Uuml;berkill&trade; it!  Don't be fooled by impostors!

<b>IF</b> you ansewered <b>YES</b> to zero or more of the above questions (of those that were
questions and not imperative statements), then <b>DON'T WAIT!</b>   Press that
big giant silver spherical DWIM button floating in the sky!


## High Concept
A semi-attractive RIA sopping with Web 1.0 gooey-goodness is just a view on your existing
vanilla documentation that you've surely been writing all along.

Nanoc3 makes making web sites fun and easy.  Markdown makes documenting your projects fun and easy.  Now, NanDoc puts the two together to make making web sites that present your markdown-documented projects tons of fun and super easy.


## Installation

(this is fragile and very subject to change:)
    from the command line:
    ~~~
    ~/tmp > git clone git@github.com:hipe/nandoc.git
    ~/tmp > cd nandoc
    ~/tmp/nandoc > rake gem
    ~/tmp/nandoc > gem install -n ~/bin pkg/nandoc-0.0.0.gem
    ~~~


## Usage Summary

Start with  a markdown-formatted README file:

(see: test.rb - "basic usage -- readme")

<br />

Then, next to this readme create a nanoc3 site/project with
nanDoc&reg;-powered&trade; nanoc&copy;:

(see: test.rb - 'basic usage -- create site')

<br />

Finally, compile your site with the nanoc3 `compile` command:

(see: test.rb - 'basic usage -- create site' - 'compile site')

<br />

From the command line start the nanoc3 (`adsf`) server:
    from the command line:
    ~~~
    ~/tmp/my-site >nandoc view
    ~/tmp/my-site >
    ~~~

<br />

If all the bells are polished and whistles tuned, you will have a
site as handsome, usable as self-unawarely-understatedly brilliant as this
one, but stunningly and proudly your own:

(point and aim your browsing device to `http://localhost:3000/`)

<div style='border: 1px solid gray; width: 800px; padding: 0 0 1em 0;'>
  (see: test.rb - 'basic usage -- create site' - 'index page body')
  <div class='clear'>&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<br/>

This entire readme file/site showcases all of the currently exisiting site generation haxies available in the nanDoc hacks of nanoc3; and the example code and output you see above is generated from the unit tests in this project.

Even the above example page is generated by a README in a unit test and injected into this page (which itself is generated from the README of this project.)

Customizing your site is a matter of getting to know nanoc3 and discovering all the fantastic undocumented features hiding in nanDoc.

NanDoc. Genius never looked so stupid&reg;.
