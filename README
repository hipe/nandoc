# NanDoc
this is a hack. this is nanDoc.

## Summary

hack of [nanoc3](http://nanoc.stoneship.org) to generate a static site from your README etc.

## Description

Generate a static site from your README and other markdown-formatted
documentation.  Inject code examples from your unit tests into
the generated docs.  Extremely fragile hacks to nanoc3.

(This entire site is generated from a README and other docs with all
of the code examples coming from unit test "scrapes".)


## Does this match you?

* Tired of all the other unit-test-driven static documentation-site-generators
that fall short of the usual promises?

* Agile development has your doc content going rapidly stale?

* Sick of typing what you want to write by hand?

* Repeatedly hearing yourself repeat to yourself "Don't Repeat Yourself?"

* Don't underkill your documentation when it's so easy to &Uuml;berkill&trade; it!  Don't be fooled by impostors!

<b>IF</b> you ansewered <b>YES</b> to zero or more of the above questions (of those that were
questions and not imperative statements), then <b>DON'T WAIT!</b>   Press that
big giant silver spherical DWIM button floating in the sky!


## High Concept
A semi-attractive RIA sopping with Web 1.0 gooey-goodness is just a view on your existing
vanilla documentation that you've surely been writing all along.



## Installation

(this is fragile and very subject to change:)
    from the command line:
    ~~~
    ~/tmp > git clone git@github.com:hipe/nandoc.git
    ~/tmp > cd nandoc
    ~/tmp/nandoc > rake gem
    ~/tmp/nandoc > gem install -n ~/bin pkg/nandoc-0.0.0.gem
    ~~~


## Usage Summary

Start with  a markdown-formatted README file:

(see: test.rb - "basic usage -- readme")

<br />

Then, next to this readme create a nanoc3 site project with
nanDoc&reg;-powered&trade; nanoc&copy;:

(see: test.rb - 'basic usage -- create site')

<br />

Finally, compile your site with the nanoc3 compile command:

(see: test.rb - 'basic usage -- create site' - 'compile site')

<br />

From the command line start the nanoc3 (adsf) server:
    from the command line:
    ~~~
    ~/tmp/my-site >nandoc view
    ~/tmp/my-site >
    ~~~

<br />

If all the bells are polished and whistles tuned, you will have a
site as handsome, usable as self-unawarely-understatedly brilliant as this
one, but stunningly and proudly your own:

(then point and aim your browsing devide to `http://localhost:3000/`)

<div style='border: 1px solid gray; width: 800px; padding: 0 0 1em 0;'>
  (see: test.rb - 'basic usage -- create site' - 'index page body')
  <div class='clear'>&nbsp;</div>
</div>

<br/>

This entire readme file/site showcases all of the currently exisiting site generation haxies available in nanDoc over nanoc3; and the example code and output you see above is generated from the unit tests in this project.

Customizing your site is a matter of getting to know nanoc3 and discovering all the fantastic undocumented features hiding in nanDoc.

NanDoc. Genius never looked so stupid&reg;.
