# NanDoc

## Credits

  * of course Denis Defreyne for [nanoc3](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/)
  * William Morgan ([trollop](http://trollop.rubyforge.org/)), whose no-nonsense site inspired the design of the nanDoc default prototype site (in fact the whole project), and whose mostly unaltered stylesheet is used for the default ruby syntax colorization.
