# nanDoc

## proviso


### nanDoc is not nanoc

nanDoc is affiliated with nanoc by name only.  They are separate projects with separate authors.  Negative experiences with nan<em>Doc</em> should not inform your pre-judgement of nan<em>oc</em> and vice versa.  (Positive experiences, however, should ;)

There is a uni-directional dependency upon nanoc by nanDoc.  In nature this is classified as a parasitic as opposed to symbiotic relationship.

### nanDoc is alpha software

nanDoc is an experimental means to an end.  i need a generate documentation for 4 or 5 of my gems and I really want tot do it by generating a lot of the examples from my existing specs.  With whatever I come up with to this end, if others happen to find it useful then ponies.  If not then it won't be the first publicly available gem I make that falls in the forest without making a sound.

breif discussions with the author of nanoc have lead me to believe that this use might be better served by looking at the `@example` tag available in YARD and [custom templates](http://gnuu.org/2009/11/18/customizing-yard-templates/) as opposed to going batshit insane with my wild hacks as i have thus far done;
but i do not have time to get up to speed on YARD now, much less overhaul nanDoc.

I find it equally likely that I won't like the YARD way and i will prefer the nanDoc way and i, like frank sinatra, will be glad i did it my way but this is all speculation at this point.  Unfortunately i have no way of knowing what future me will think of present me, except that he will be jealous of how much hair I had back then.

i will to try to adhere to the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) standard for nanDoc versions.  Fortunately for me and nanDoc at this point,
it states that:

> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change
> at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

This holds especially true for nanDoc which is very experimental and very much in flux for the time being, and as such will be in major and minor version zero for at least the next few months.

If, however, *anyone* uses nanDoc and finds some functionality of it *at all* useful, pls [email](<mailto:chip.malice@gmail.com>) me (or better yet ping `hipe` on [irc](irc://chat.freenode.net/#ruby-lang)) and I will very likely bake that functionality into what will ultimately become the public api for nanDoc.
