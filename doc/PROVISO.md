# nanDoc

## proviso

(may 13, 2010)

nadoc is an experimental means to an end.  I need a way to integrate code in my tests ("specs") with documentation generation to make sites like this for 4 or 5 of my gems.

breif discussions with the author of nanoc have lead me to believe that this use might be better served by looking at the `@example` tag available in YARD and [custom templates](http://gnuu.org/2009/11/18/customizing-yard-templates/) as opposed to going batshit insane with my wild hacks as i have thus far done;
but i do not have time to get up to speed on YARD now, much less overhaul nanDoc.

I find it equally likely that I won't like the YARD way and i will prefer the nanDoc way and i will be glad i did it my way but this is all speculation at this point.  Unfortunately i have no way of knowing what future me will think of present me, except that he will be jealous of how much hair I had back then.

i will to try to adhere to the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) standard for nanDoc versions.  Fortunately for me and nanDoc at this point,
it states that
> Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may change
> at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

This holds especially true for nanDoc which is very experimental and very much in flux for the time being, and as such nanDoc will be in major version zero for at least the next few months.

If, however, *anyone* uses nanDoc and finds some functionality of it *at all* useful, pls [email](<chip.malice@gmail.com) me (or better yet ping `hipe` on [irc](irc://chat.freenode.net/#ruby-lang)) and I will very likely bake that functionality into what will ultimately become the public api for nanDoc.
